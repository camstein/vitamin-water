							<p>Map created with Leaflet depicting potential volcanic hazerdous zones if Mt. Rainer were to erupt. The map also displays the locations of schools in Pierce County. Schools located inside the potential volcanic hazerdous zones may be destroyed in the event of an eruption.</p>

							<h2>T GIS 503 Lab 3 - Autumn 2020</h2>
							<p>Both maps were created with Mapbox. The first map includes a geocoder and the ability to switch basemaps. The second map includes a custom basemap, a layer showing hospitals, and a layer showing the counties in Washington. When hovering over the hospitals or clicking on the counties a popup will appear with information.</p>

							<h2>T GIS 503 Lab 4 - Autumn 2020</h2>
							<p>Both maps were created with Mapbox. The first is a choropleth map displaying the number of reported COVID-19 cases by county in Washington. The second is a choropleth map displaying the number of reported COVID-19 deaths by county in Washington. Both maps have the ability to toggle layers of the hospitals and schools. When a county is click on a popup will appear with COVID-19 information about that county.</p>

							<h2>MSGT Capstone Project</h2>
							<p>The transportation sector is responsible for the largest share of greenhouse gas emissions in the United States. Greenhouse gas emissions could be reduced if drivers in the United States would leave their SOVs behind and choose to use public transit as their primary mode of transportation. Unfortunately, public transit suffers from low ridership numbers because people in the United States are dependent on their automobiles. The scope of previous studies has been limited because they were focused individual cities. By broadening the scope of analysis and focusing on entire metropolitan transit agencies the resulting data will give a better ability in the decision-making process about future transit projects. This study attempts to create more effective public transportation and increase public transit ridership by comparing population density and median household income to current public transit ridership.</p>
							<p>Greater population density correlates to greater public transit ridership, while greater median household income correlates to lower public transit ridership. A model built on regression analysis of population density and median household income as the independent variables and transit ridership as the dependent variable will be built as the approach to finding a correlation between the variables. Increasing population density can increase public transit ridership numbers and help reduce greenhouse gas emissions, while increasing the median household income will reduce public transit ridership. Transit agencies must overhaul their current systems by changing routes and transit center locations to more densely populated areas and cities must maintain more sustainable median household incomes to increase public transit ridership.</p>
